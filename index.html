    Turning data into intelligence.

  <section>
    <p>
      I work at the intersection of data, machine learning, and intelligent systems.
      With 3+ years of hands-on experience, I build production-grade AI systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      From statistical models to large language models, I enjoy understanding
      systems from first principles and engineering them for real-world impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in evidence over intuition.
