      "Turning data into intelligence. Turning models into systems"
    </p>

    <!-- Main Text -->
    <p>
      I am a final-year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India,
      with a strong focus on machine learning, deep learning, and intelligent systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past 3+ years, I have worked on internships and advanced projects,
      translating theory into real-world, production-ready AI solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      From classical statistical models to large language models (next-token predictors),
      I enjoy understanding systems from first principles and engineering them
      for reliability and impact.

<!-- ================= ABOUT ================= -->

<section class="section">

  <p>
    My journey into programming and data science began with curiosity and gradually
    evolved into a passion for building intelligent systems that solve meaningful problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I actively explore predictive analytics, LLM-based agents, scalable ML pipelines,
    and business intelligence systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on bridging academic understanding with industry-grade implementation.
