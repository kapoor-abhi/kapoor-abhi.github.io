    <!-- Main Text -->
    <p>
      I am a final-year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India, with a strong
      focus on machine learning, deep learning, and intelligent systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have gained hands-on industry experience through internships at Xibotix Private Limited
      and Redcloud Services, where I contributed to real-world data pipelines, predictive models,
      and AI-driven solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside industry work, I collaborated closely with faculty members on academic research
      and applied projects, strengthening my foundation in system design, experimentation,
      and technical communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past three years, I have focused on translating theoretical concepts into
      scalable, production-ready machine learning systems with measurable business impact.

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    My journey with computers began in early childhood when I was first introduced to technology
    during my kindergarten years. From an early age, I developed a strong curiosity for how
    machines functioned, often experimenting with hardware components and system configurations.
  </p>
  <p>
    By fifth grade, I had started learning programming through online resources and hands-on
    experimentation with Visual Basic and system-level customization. Through repeated trial,
    error, and system recovery, I learned how to diagnose, repair, and maintain computing
    environments independently.
  </p>
  <p>
    This habit of learning by building, breaking, and rebuilding evolved into a strong foundation
    in software engineering, data science, and machine learning. Today, I actively work on
    predictive analytics, LLM-based systems, and scalable ML pipelines, with a focus on transforming
    academic research into reliable, industry-grade solutions.
